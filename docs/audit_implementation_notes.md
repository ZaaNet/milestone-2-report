# Audit Recommendations – Implementation Notes

All items from [Audit Report](audit_report.md) have been implemented. Summary below.

---

## 1. ZaaNetStorage.sol

- **Pausable:** Contract now inherits `Pausable`; added `whenStorageNotPaused` and `pause()` / `unpause()` (owner-only). All state-changing, allowed-caller functions use `whenStorageNotPaused` so that when Storage is paused, no one (including Payment/Network) can update it.
- **getNetworksPaginated:** Returns only networks for which `networkExists[id]` is true. Two-pass logic: count existing in range, allocate that size, then fill. `total` is still `networkIdCounter`.

---

## 2. ZaaNetPayment.sol

- **Daily limit on success only:** Removed `withinDailyLimit` modifier. `processPayment` now checks `getRemainingDailyLimit() >= _grossAmount` and, **after** a successful `_executePayment`, does `dailyWithdrawals[today] += _grossAmount`. Failed payments no longer consume the daily limit.
- **rescueERC20:** Added `require(_erc20 != address(usdt), "Cannot rescue payment token");` so the payment token cannot be rescued.
- **withdrawToken:** After transferring, calls `storageContract.updateZaanetWithdrawalsAmount(_amount)` so Storage’s withdrawal stats include owner withdrawals.  
  **Deployment:** Payment contract **must** be set as an allowed caller on Storage (`setAllowedCaller(paymentAddress, true)`) for `withdrawToken` to succeed when calling Storage.
- **Duplicate check removed:** The second `msg.sender == paymentWallet` check and the unused `paymentWallet` variable were removed from `processPayment`.
- **Constructor:** Added `require(_networkContract != address(0), "network zero");`.
- **Emergency mode:** Added `emergencyMode()` to the inline `IZaaNetAdmin` and `require(!adminContract.emergencyMode(), "Emergency mode active")` at the start of `processPayment` and `processBatchPayments`. When Admin is in emergency mode, payments are blocked.

---

## 3. ZaaNetNetwork.sol

- **deactivateNetwork:** Added `nonReentrant` and `require(!adminContract.emergencyMode(), "Emergency mode active")`.
- **Emergency mode:** Added `emergencyMode()` to the inline `IZaaNetAdmin`. `registerNetwork` and `updateNetwork` now require `!adminContract.emergencyMode()`. When Admin is in emergency mode, registration and updates are blocked.

---

## 4. ZaaNetAdmin.sol

- **getCurrentFees:** Now returns three values to match the interface: `(platformFeePercent, hostingFee, treasuryAddress)`.

---

## 5. interface/IZaaNetStorage.sol

- **Aligned with implementation:** Removed legacy `increaseZaaNetEarnings`, `getZaaNetEarnings`, and `incrementSessionId`. Added: `increaseClientVoucherFeeEarnings`, `increaseHostVoucherFeeEarnings`, `updateTotalSessionPaymentsAmount`, `updateZaanetWithdrawalsAmount`, `updateZaanetHostingFeeEarnings`, `pause()`, `unpause()`.

---

## Deployment / Integration Checklist

1. **Storage:** After deployment, set Payment and Network contracts as allowed callers with `setAllowedCaller(paymentContractAddress, true)` and `setAllowedCaller(networkContractAddress, true)`. Otherwise `withdrawToken` (and other Payment/Network → Storage calls) will revert.
2. **Emergency mode:** When `adminContract.emergencyMode()` is true, Payment (processPayment, processBatchPayments) and Network (registerNetwork, updateNetwork, deactivateNetwork) will revert with “Emergency mode active”. Toggle via Admin’s `toggleEmergencyMode()` (emergency operators or owner).
3. **Storage pause:** Owner can call `storageContract.pause()`. When paused, no allowed caller can update Storage (networks, earnings, counters) until `unpause()`.

---

## Finishing the implementation

1. **Install and build (from `smart-contracts/`):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This runs the default Hardhat test suite. The file `test/ZaaNet.audit.implementation.test.ts` covers the audit-related behavior:
   - Storage pause blocks network registration until unpause.
   - Emergency mode blocks `processPayment` and `registerNetwork`.
   - `rescueERC20` reverts when rescuing the payment token (USDT).
   - `getCurrentFees()` returns three values (platformFee, hostingFee, treasury).
   - `withdrawToken` updates Storage’s `zaanetWithdrawalsAmount` when Payment is an allowed caller.
   - `getNetworksPaginated` returns only existing networks.
   - Daily limit is consumed only after a successful `processPayment`.

3. **Deploy (e.g. Arbitrum Sepolia):**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/ZaaNetDeploymentModule.ts --network arbitrumSepolia
   ```
   The deployment module already sets Payment and Network (and Admin) as allowed callers on Storage, so `withdrawToken` and other cross-contract calls will work.

Run your test suite and deployment script to confirm everything compiles and behaves as expected.
